        <b style="color: chocolate;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</b>
         After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.

        I've started putting up a <a href="slide01.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. 
        If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.
