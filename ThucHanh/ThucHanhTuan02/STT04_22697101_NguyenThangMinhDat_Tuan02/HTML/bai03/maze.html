            <p>
                Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from
                agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe, 
                mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in
                 Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside 
                 of Council Bluffs.<br><br>
                Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn MAzes. We hope that 
                your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze as we did
                building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at 
                this year's Corn Maze and AutumnFest.<br><br>
                Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twist 
                and turns that's good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventures you are 
                as you wind through the maze while taking an interactive quiz. Answer the 
                questions correctly and receive additional dues to solve the maze. For families 
                with young children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the 
                first in your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret spots. This 
                maze is the perfect size and height for little ones. Resting places and educational 
                displays are scattered throughout.<br><br>
                There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water bottles with you! 
                No one under the age of 12 will be allowed in the maze without an adult at any time.
