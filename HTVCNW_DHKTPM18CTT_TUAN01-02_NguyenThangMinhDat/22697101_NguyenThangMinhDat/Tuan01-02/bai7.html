            A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles
            at the sides of the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile.
            Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at he corner of the eyes,
            an action known as a "Ducheme smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction
            may be perceived as insincere.
